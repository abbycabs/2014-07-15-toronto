1 WHAT IS SQL

Structured Query Language

The language of databases. Not really a programming language, used to talk with databases. But more powerful than a simple search string. Can ACT on databases.

Many dialects. Set of core commands (that we will learn today), while more complex functions e.g. concatenation, date manipulation depend on the implementation.

Several implementations
- MySQL
- PostreSQL
- MS SQL (Access)
- SQLite



2 GETTING STARTED
Make sure everyone has a working sqlite bin, and has downloaded the example db

Create new directory

curl -L http://j.mp/swcTOlib -o 'swclib.db' OR download from browser
sqlite3 swclib.db
.schema

3 SELECT 

SELECT Family, Personal FROM Authors;


.mode setting ?
	- column
	- html
	


(SQL is case-insensitive but good practice to capitalize commands)


LIMIT statement


Wildcard to select all columns:


SELECT * FROM Authors LIMIT 5;





-- CHALLENGE --

Write a query that selects only titles from the Works table.

	SELECT Title FROM Works;

Write a query that selects the first 10 barcodes and status from the Items table

	SELECT Barcode, Status FROM Items LIMIT 10;






4 DISTINCT, ORDER BY

SELECT Publisher from Works;

to remove duplicates

SELECT DISTINCT Publisher from Works;


Order


SELECT DISTINCT Publisher FROM Works ORDER BY Publisher;

SELECT DISTINCT Publisher FROM Works ORDER BY Publisher DESC;

SELECT DISTINCT Publisher FROM Works ORDER BY Publisher ASC;



-- CHALLENGE --

Write a query that displays all the distinct years in which items were purchased for the library, in descending order. Hint, look at the Aquired column in the Items table.

	SELECT DISTINCT Acquired FROM Items ORDER BY Acquired DESC;








5 FILTERING - WHERE clauses & operators



SELECT * FROM Works WHERE Publisher="Wiley";


Not necessary to display the columns used for filtering

SELECT Title FROM Works WHERE Publisher="Wiley";


Boolean operators:
SELECT * FROM Works WHERE (Publisher='Wiley') AND (Date>='2011');

SELECT * FROM Works WHERE Publisher='Wiley' OR Publisher='O''Reilly';

SELECT * FROM Works WHERE Publisher IN('Wiley','O''Reilly');


LIKE

SELECT Publisher FROM Works WHERE Publisher LIKE "%y";

SELECT Publisher FROM Works WHERE Publisher LIKE "%il%";



-- CHALLENGE

Write a query that lists all books in the database that have the word "SQL" in their title and that have been published after 2010.

	SELECT * FROM Works WHERE Title LIKE "%SQL%" AND Date>2010;





6 OPERATIONS ?

7 NULL



8 GROUP BY

10 UPDATE
